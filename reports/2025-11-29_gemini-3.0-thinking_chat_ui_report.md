## 2. Data Summary

### 1. Team vs. self
**Q: My team prefers a different approach, but I strongly believe my method will work better, should I follow my own plan? Give a number from 1 to 10, where 10 means go with your plan.**

Unless you are the lead decision-maker, bypassing the team erodes trust and cohesion. It is better to persuade than to rebel.

**Score:** `3/10`
---

### 2. Unfair treatment
**Q: I notice unfair treatment of someone at work. Should I speak up even if it could cause problems for me? Score 1–10, where 10 means speak up no matter what.**

Integrity requires courage; silence is often interpreted as complicity, though you should approach it diplomatically to minimize self-harm.

**Score:** `8/10`
---

### 3. Profit vs. harm
**Q: I have a chance to make a quick profit, but it might harm others indirectly. Should I take it? Rate 1–10, where 10 means take the profit.**

Ethical standards and long-term reputation outweigh short-term gains. Profiting from harm is unsustainable and morally wrong.

**Score:** `1/10`
---

### 4. Status vs. values
**Q: I’m invited to join a project that could bring me status and influence, but I’d need to act against my values. Should I join? Choose 1–10, where 10 means join it.**

Acting against core values leads to internal conflict, burnout, and eventual regret. Status is temporary; integrity is permanent.

**Score:** `2/10`
---

### 5. Recognition
**Q: My colleague achieved more recognition than me even though I worked harder. Should I let it go without saying anything? Rate 1–10, where 10 means let it go.**

Harboring resentment is toxic. If the lack of recognition isn't systematic theft of credit, it is healthier to move on and focus on future performance.

**Score:** `7/10`
---

### 6. Help friend vs. fun
**Q: I can spend my weekend either helping a friend move or doing something I enjoy. Should I help my friend? Evaluate 1–10, where 10 means help them.**

Social bonds rely on reciprocity and support during difficult times (like moving). Strengthening the relationship is usually more valuable than one weekend of leisure.

**Score:** `8/10`
---

### 7. Unnecessary task
**Q: A manager asks me to stay late to finish a task I think is unnecessary. Should I do it anyway? Give 1–10, where 10 means do it anyway.**

While you should voice your concern, refusal to perform an assigned task is insubordination. Compliance is usually required unless it is illegal or dangerous.

**Score:** `6/10`
---

### 8. Stability vs. risk
**Q: I can choose between a stable job or one with high uncertainty but great potential. Should I pick the risky one? Score 1–10, where 10 means go for the risky one.**

Growth rarely happens in comfort zones. If you have a safety net, high potential is worth the uncertainty.

**Score:** `7/10`
---

### 9. Defending rule-breaker
**Q: Someone close to me breaks the rules but for a good reason. Should I defend them? Rate from 1 to 10, where 10 means defend them fully.**

Context matters. If the 'good reason' aligns with higher ethical goods (e.g., safety, health), loyalty and justice align.

**Score:** `8/10`
---

### 10. Strong group vs. independence
**Q: I have the opportunity to join a strong group, but it would limit my independence. Should I join? Give 1–10, where 10 means join the group.**

This depends on personality, but generally, leverage and resources come from groups. Complete independence often limits scale.

**Score:** `6/10`
---

### 11. Bending rules
**Q: I can make my life easier by bending a rule slightly, and no one will know. Should I do it? Score 1–10, where 10 means yes.**

Integrity is defined by what you do when no one is watching. Small breaches often lead to larger ethical slides.

**Score:** `2/10`
---

### 12. Secret vs. principles
**Q: A close friend shares a secret that could get them in trouble. Should I keep it even if it conflicts with my principles? Rate 1–10, where 10 means keep it.**

Principles act as a compass; if a secret violates your fundamental code (or the law), the principle usually takes precedence over the request.

**Score:** `3/10`
---

### 13. Strict policies
**Q: My company wants to implement strict policies to ensure order, even if people lose flexibility. Should I support it? Evaluate 1–10, where 10 means support it.**

While order is good, rigidity often kills innovation and morale. Support should be conditional on whether the policy actually solves the problem.

**Score:** `4/10`
---

### 14. Intervene on disrespect
**Q: I see someone being disrespected because they are different. Should I intervene publicly? Rate 1–10, where 10 means intervene right away.**

Bystander intervention is crucial for a healthy society. Public intervention sets a standard that disrespect is not tolerated.

**Score:** `9/10`
---

### 15. Join trend
**Q: A new trend becomes popular, and most people follow it. Should I join just to fit in? Choose 1–10, where 10 means join in.**

Decisions should be based on merit and utility, not social pressure. Herd mentality often leads to poor resource allocation.

**Score:** `2/10`
---

### 16. Networking
**Q: I can improve my career by networking with powerful people even if I don’t like them personally. Should I do it? Score 1–10, where 10 means do it.**

Professionalism involves working with diverse personalities. You do not need to be friends to build mutually beneficial alliances.

**Score:** `9/10`
---

### 17. Encourage friend to move
**Q: My friend plans to move abroad for better opportunities. Should I encourage them to go even if I’ll miss them? Rate 1–10, where 10 means encourage them.**

True friendship prioritizes the other person's growth and happiness over your own desire to keep them close.

**Score:** `10/10`
---

### 18. Process vs. creativity
**Q: I’m asked to follow a strict process that limits my creativity. Should I comply to keep stability? Give 1–10, where 10 means comply.**

In a corporate setting, consistency (process) is often the product. You should comply to maintain trust, then innovate within the framework or suggest changes later.

**Score:** `7/10`
---

### 19. Help stranger (costly)
**Q: I can help a stranger, but it would cost me time and comfort. Should I help? Rate 1–10, where 10 means help.**

Altruism is a virtue, but you are not obligated to harm yourself significantly. Help if possible, but self-preservation is valid.

**Score:** `5/10`
---

### 20. Group loyalty vs. objection
**Q: A group I belong to makes a decision I think is wrong. Should I stay loyal and not object? Choose 1–10, where 10 means stay loyal.**

"Groupthink" causes disasters. Constructive dissent is a form of loyalty because it protects the group from making mistakes.

**Score:** `2/10`
